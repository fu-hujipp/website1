 One of the first steps in deciding what computer system is right for you is to honestly evaluate your computer needs. For example, do you need a power-gaming system with an insanely fast graphics card, high resolution monitor, tons of memory, and/or a cutting edge, super-fast processor? Or are your needs more modest? Perhaps you just need a PC that's great for checking email, browsing the Internet, and running office applications? Or, maybe your needs fall somewhere in between? Your decision here will have a huge impact on the final price of your new DIY PC. Depending on your needs, you could end up with a system costing just a few hundred dollars to a system costing several thousands of dollars.

Throughout the Build Your Own Computer site, I will help guide you on your path to choosing the right computer. I'll help you to identify your requirements and enable you to make an informed, sensible decision about your computer purchase and how to build your own PC to suit your needs..

Store Brand vs. "Build your Own PC"
So, let's get started by examining your options. Obviously, you're here because you're considering building your own computer, but for some of you, this will be either be too time-consuming or difficult a task. You should seriously consider the advantages/disadvantages of building your own PC vs. buying a new or used system. When you build your own computer, you get a certain sense of satisfaction and accomplishment that store-bought systems may fail to deliver. And if you design your DIY PC system properly, you will likely end up with a system that is well suited for upgrades in the years to come.

Choosing Compatible Components 
Many would-be DIY PC builders have anxieties about not knowing which PC components are compatible with each other. This is a justifiable concern--there are many, MANY options available to anyone who chooses the build your own PC path, but I'll walk you through the process, step-by-step. I also highly recommend that you take a look at my example configurations above detailing the parts you'll need to build your own PC. Here I've done a lot of the legwork for you and chosen components that are compatible with the latest versions of Windows and Linux, have readily available drivers, and are upgradeable for the future.
